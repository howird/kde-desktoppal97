# DesktopPal97

"Your first-class visual companion for your personal desktop computer."

DesktopPal97 is a rebellious yet classic fantasy desktop imitating the 90s aesthetics.
It is a full-featured theme for KDE Plasma including Global Theme, customized Lockscreen and Logout screen, Plasma Theme, Aurorae theme, Kvantum theme, and SDDM theme. Even a custom KWin Overview effect and KWin Windowview effect is available.

A proper GTK3/4 theme is missing but any contribution is welcomed. However, it looks quite decent with the default Breeze GTK theme, too.

DesktopPal97 uses the 256 color VGA palette.
