# DesktopPal97

*"Your first-class visual companion for your personal desktop computer."*

DesktopPal97 is a rebellious yet classic fantasy desktop imitating the 90s aesthetic.
It is a full-featured theme for KDE Plasma, including the Global Theme, a customized lockscreen and logout screens, a Plasma Theme, an Aurorae theme, a Kvantum theme, and an SDDM theme. Even a custom KWin Overview effect and a KWin Windowview effect are available.

A proper GTK3/4 theme is missing, but any contribution is welcome. However, it looks quite decent with the default Breeze GTK theme, too.

DesktopPal97 takes its inspiration from the desktop GUIs from the 1990s and 2000s (e.g., KDE2), and it uses the 256-color VGA palette.
